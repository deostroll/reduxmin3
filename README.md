This is a mock of the swagger-ui redux system. As of this writing, I have no idea why their redux system
is designed the way it is. 

The main goal of this project is to understand how to make layout generation faster. In other words, 
make react a little faster.

Other than that this project also serves as a good base to understand what their redux system is. Hoping
that if you dig long enough you figure it out on your own. Trust me, in one reading, its very hard to
figure the intent behind why code was written that way.

Leagalese:

The swagger-ui is created and maintained by the swagger api team. Their website: http://swagger.io . Some code
here is a direct copy from their repo; the other parts are slightly have been modified only with the 
intension of hacking and finding out what their real intent was.
